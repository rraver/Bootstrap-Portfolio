      <p>Hi, I'm Robert Raver! This is my first project as an intro into primarily HTML and CSS.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I started working with computers at a young age, after taking classes in middle school and high school I started getting into network infrastructure.  At a young age I started working towards my A+, CNA, CCNA, and CCNP certifications.  Graduating high school a year early I received these certifications being the youngest CCNP certified inte world.</p>
      <br>
      <p>From then I was spent my life in network engineering, architecture, and management.  I was able to spend time in systems engineering as well.  I reloacted to California to pursue an oppurtunity at the one of the largest SAAS providers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I ran out of stuff to say so here's some random stuff.... </p>
      <br>
      <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
